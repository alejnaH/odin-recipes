        <li>Cornstarch: </li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>   
        <li>Egg yolk</li>    
        <li>Baking soda, flour and salt</li>    

    </ul></p>

    <p><h3>Instructions: </h3></p>
    <p><h3><ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <p>🔸</p>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. 
            <br>Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry 
            <br>ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. 
            <br>Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best
            <br>to combine them.</li>
        <p>🔸</p>
        <li>Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly 
            <br>recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.</li>
        <p>🔸</p>
        <li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
        <p>🔸</p>
        <li>Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for 
            <br>XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a ball, 
            <br>making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. 
            <br>Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. </li>
        <p>🔸</p>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.)
            <br> The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. 
            <br>Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 
            <br>minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
